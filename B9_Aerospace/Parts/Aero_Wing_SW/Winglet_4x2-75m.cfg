    description = Growing tired from being forced to use dozens of old small control surfaces for their increasingly enormous aircraft designs, kerbal engineers came up with a set of larger ones. This winglet, coming in three large, equally ridiculous sizes, can be of great use whenever you have problems controlling those unsettingly large monstrosities you like to build so much.
