    description = RCS thrusters are used to rotate and translate your spacecraft in the absense of other means to do so (control surfaces won't help you turn outside of the atmoshpere and reaction wheels can't help you move to the side). This five-thruster model is shielded to produce less aerodynamic drag and has performance comparable to the widely used standard type.
