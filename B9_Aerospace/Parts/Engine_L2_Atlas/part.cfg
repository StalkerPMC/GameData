    title = L2 Atlas Low-Profile Engine
    manufacturer = Tetragon Projects
    description = This engine was brought to life as a replacement for LV-909 model. After initial tests of new landing legs revealed that clearance provided by them was extremely tiny. Naturally, instead of making better landing legs, ingenious kerbal engineers created a whole new low-profile engine. Impressive flatness has a tradeoff in 600% more likely spontaneous combustion, but thankfully, our engines are never tested for that! Fly safe!
