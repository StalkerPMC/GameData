	description = As a follow up to the underwhelmingly popular 1x4 series, the KRX also includes concentrator lenses for extra power at the cost of mass. On the KRX, support struts are sacrificed to cut down that mass, the result is a panel that is quite light for its generation capabilities. Just don't sneeze on it.
