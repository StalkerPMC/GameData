CHANGELOG:
======================================================================

UPDATE Dec 19, 2013 : Version 32b
---------------------------------------------------------
Docking Cam: Working again
Lazor System: Space center menu should display more appropriately.


UPDATE Dec 18, 2013 : Version 32
---------------------------------------------------------
All plugins: Now compatible with KSP 0.23
Update Lazor System or the docking cam to apply the fix.


UPDATE Oct 17, 2013 : Version 31
---------------------------------------------------------
All plugins: Now compatible with KSP 0.22
All plugins: Requires LazorSystem to be installed and will have parts only in the download. All plugins: Download Lazor System here... http://www.kerbalspaceport.com/lazor-system/
All plugins: Added to career mode under Experimental Electrics with the following exceptions.
Robotic Arms Pack: Unlocked in career mode with Robotics
Lazor Guided Missiles: unlocked in career mode with Experimental Rocketry.
Lazor Docking Cam: unlocked in career mode with the docking ports.
Lazor Docking Cam: This download is essentially Lazor System without the parts.


UPDATE Aug 24, 2013 : Version 30
---------------------------------------------------------
LazorSystem: Updated the models for the system modules and all the lazors.
LazorSystem: The green system will now rotate the lazors properly
LazorSystem: Scanning with the green main lazor fixed.
LazorSystem: Fixed a bug where the system would become unresponsive outside Kerbin's SOI.
LazorSystem: Vision enhancer is now working again.
LazorSystem: Remote control has been fixed.
RoboticArmsPack: Fixed a bug with docking.


UPDATE Jul 26, 2013 : Version 29
---------------------------------------------------------
LazorSystem: All mods received a KSP 0.21 compability fix. There are still remaining issues so please report any issues you find. Please include steps to reproduce and upload your KSP_Data/output_log.txt somwhere.
LazorSystem: Updated the tractor beam controller for the hovering system. (Actually a huge and complicated update.)
This new controller should make the tractor hovering beams work more reliably for a wider range of vessels. And reduce the chance for controller failure.
LazorSystem, Afterburner: Rewrote the system to a proportional thrust and fuel consumption model. It works best for airplanes. If you ever need more thrust to get a plane off the runway, this is the system to use.
Robotic arm: Fixed a bug where the camera window would close down (until reload) when a held part was decoupled. 
Sunbeam: The sound is back.


UPDATE Jun 10, 2013 : Version 28b
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazorpowered kerbals on EVA: Now with 100% more working lazor.
Lazor System: Fixed an issue where lazors would be turned off (until forced on again) when hitting the vessel they were attached to.
Lazor System: Fixed an issue with lazors shooting through vessels.


UPDATE Jun 8, 2013 : Version 28
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor Powered: All plugins received a stability updates so even though the features/bugfixes you want are on this list, it might have gotten fixed indirectly. A re-install is highly recommended.
Lazor Powered: It is now only possible to set the view distance of vessels. All other settings are handled dynamically. This should lead to greatly improved performance when running the game with a longer than standard view distance.
Lazor System: Massive performance boost when running the system with a lot of lazors. (in average you can now run 2x the amount of lazors with the same drain on your computer)
Lazor System: Lazor powered kerbals in seats should now work properly
Lazor System: Launch clamps will no longer explode or accidentally follow the vessel.
Lazor System: Lazors are no longer programmed to self destruct when no main module is present.
Lazor System: Remote Control updated. It now requires an active and focused lazor system to run. This system will now also have an option to use control surfaces + torque ("Use control surfaces") to control the vessel. If this option is not enabled, only torque will be used.
Lazor System: Fixed a minor issue with targets not being set properly when switching between vessels.
Robotic Arms: Kerbals on eva can once again be grabbed by the robotic arm.
Docking Cam: Added an option to resize the camera to a extra large window.


UPDATE May 24, 2013 : Version 27
---------------------------------------------------------
KSP 0.20 Compatibility enabled


UPDATE APRIL 26, 2013 : Version 26
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor System EVA: Added a decouple and weld function to the EVA's coming out of vessel with Lazor System installed. This system is speciffically made to work with my robotic arms and it is possible to use it to move parts on your vessel in-flight. This system has been tested using one arm. I can't guarantee that it will work if you create elaborate chains of arms or circular connections. So if you want it to work in those cases you will have to test it yourself and send me the steps to reproduce any bugs you find. The decoupling beam will decouple the selected part from it's parent. If using this with the robotic arms, keep in mind that the parent part is in the direction of the current root part of the vessel. Generally if the arm control is enabled, this is away from the arm, and towards the arm if the controls are grayed out. The weld beam will weld two selected parts together. The parts need to be close to eachother for this to work properly.

Lazor System EVA: Lazor powered EVA's should not loose their connection to their vessels as frequently anymore.

Lazor System, Lazor guided flight (Red) system: Pid controller settings are now persistent

Lazor System, Lazor guided flight (Red) system: Fixed lazor guided flight directions in rocket mode. The system's directions will now depend on where you are controlling from.

Lazor System, Tractor beam (Magenta) system: Now with simplified movement control.

Lazor System, Tractor beam (Magenta) system in hover mode: The stabilizor should now properly stabilize the craft independent on the controlling command pod's position/rotation.

Lazor System Config: Improved grouping/ungrouping functions.

All plugins: Linux compatibility fix.

Lazor Docking Cam: Fixed some issues with installing the package on MAC


UPDATE MAR 18, 2013 : Version 25
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor System: Added Lazor Powered settings panel to the space center. In addition to lazor system settings, you can set loading distance for all lazor powered plugins from here.

Robotic Arms Pack: Added energy requirement to all robotic arms. Having the camera on, moving the arm and magnetizing will have overlapping electric charge requirements.

Robotic Arms Pack: Fixed decoupling bug.

Robotic Arms Pack: Fixed some exceptions caused by the magnetized part being destroyed.

Robotic Arms Pack: EVA's can no longer be magnetized.


UPDATE MAR 7, 2013 : Version 24
---------------------------------------------------------
NEW, Robotic Arms Pack: This pack contains two replicas of real life robotic arms used space. The CanadArm2 from the ISS and the Buran manipulator from the shuttle with the same name. The arms comes with a camera attached to the tip of the arm. This interface is also the one you will use to move the arm around. In order to grab other vessels both arms are equipped by a magnet. Whenever you grab something both vessels will automatically dock with eachother. This is necessary in order to be able to save and load properly. The arms are also warp capable, with and without load. Keep in mind that the arms can not handle excessive loads within a gravity field. Accelleration is also not reccommended. And finally, the arm will produce force according to newtonian laws, if you experience too much wobble, use the slow speed setting. This can be activated with the CAPSLOCK key.

WeaponsPack: Missiles now deal damage and will explode parts within range. All missiles comes pre-configured with realistic values however it is possible to tweak the destruction capabilities of the missiles with a .cfg edit. Destructive and explosion parameters can be modified in the LazorWarhead module. destructionRadius specifies the radius of the destruction sphere. blastRadius specifies the radius showckwave sphere. If either is set to 0, no destruction of shockwave will occur. And finally if the blast radius is set to a value lower than the destruction radius, it is unlikely any shockwave will occur as the parts will already be destroyed.

LazorSystem: Added a dynamic vessel loading distance controller. The extended range will be activated for all vessels in your game when timewarp is not engaged. Due to this change, all lanuch clamps will be destroyed on takeoff (to avoid the launch clamp bug)

Added a new function to the EVA system. The lazor on the helmet can now be used to explode parts. Each explosion cost 10 EVA fuel.

Fixed an issue with EVA's that could cause the exit button in the pause menu to not work. If this bug still persists, make sure to delete the file "KSP_win/romfarer/config.cfg" and the file "persistent.data" in the same folder (if they exist).

Fixed an issue that could cause lazor system to lag in the VAB.

Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash/lag when vessels were loaded with lazor emitters but no lazor system attached. Fixed as follows: whenever a lazor emitter is loaded on a vessel without the main lazor system module. The emitter will instantly explode. It is "safe" to decouple or undock lazor emitters from a lazor system vessel. The emitters will only explode when you load


UPDATE Feb 18, 2013 : Version 23b (0.18.4 patch)
---------------------------------------------------------
EVA first person view is once again working

EVA: Added mouse look for the lazor on the kerbal eva suit. Toggle this on/off with the button on the GUI (when lazor is on) or use hotkey "1". Why has this feature been added? Because soon you will need to target parts while on EVA. To explode them! :D

Fixed an issue causing the GUI to dissapear.

Fixed an issue with sound crashing the game.

NOTE: This is the 3rd patch for KSP 0.18.4. It has fixed every issue i am aware of. If you find more bugs please make sure you have the latest version of everything.

NOTE: LazorSystem is NOT backwards compatible due to technical reasons. It requires KSP version 0.18.4

NOTE: And in other words. Previous versions of LazorSystem will not work with KSP version 0.18.4

SO: Get KSP version 0.18.4 and download and install LazorSystem again. Thanks, and enjoy.



UPDATE Feb 12, 2013 : Version 23
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor System: Upgraded the missile control system with better algorithms for extra precision.

New Plugin Package: Lazor Guided Weapons: This package contains 3 new missiles, a short range one, a medium range one, and a cruise missile. This package is meant to replace the Examples package and it comes as a separate download at the spaceport. All 3 missiles should work with or without lazor system on the vessel but they do require the Romfarer.dll installed. Every missile has built-in cameras so you can see what the missile is seeing. Special explosion effects have been created for these missiles

New Plugin Package: Sunbeam is now in it's own package on the spaceport

Lazor Cam: Added a "Lock" button, when enabled the camera will follow the target you have assigned with Lazor System or the built in targeting.

Lazor Cam: The camera can now be operated from another vessel. Simply open up the camera, switch to a vessel within 95km and the camera window will still be open. This way you can watch your own rocket from the ground on launch.



UPDATE Jan 26, 2013 : Version 22
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor Cam: This is a camera you can place anywhere on a vessel. When activated the camera will open a gui window much similar to the camera window that already comes with Lazor System. When active the camera will require 0.1 units of electric charge per second. You may place as many cameras on a vessel as your computer/monitor can handle and you can have all of them active at toggle button is activated the camera will be fixed to the movement of the vessel it is attached to. If the "Fix" is off, the camera will keep pointing in the set direction ignoring the vessel's movements.

Global Config: Added a toggle button to turn power generation on/off.

Fixed an issue that caused the system to crash when vessels with a tracking indicator exploded.



UPDATE Jan 18, 2013 : Version 21
---------------------------------------------------------
The lazor show is over: Only lazors attached to enabled (switched on) subsystems will have visible lazor beams.

Parameters Tab: Added a graphical overlay which shows latitudes and longitudes on planets in map view and high orbit.

The GUI will now not overwrite anything and no other plugin should overwrite it either.

LGF rocket: RSAS etc. should now work properly after docking.

LGF rocket: Added Target Velocity +-, Direction +-, Relative Velocity +- and Relative Direction.

LGF rocket: Added a RCS Translation system which uses rcs to cancel out relative velocity (usefull for docking, requires a target) and surface velocity (usefull for canceling drift when landing rockets). Also added Translate forward and back buttons.

LGF rocket: Overhauled the controllers for the whole system. It should now be more accurate, use less fuel, and also take rcs into account.

Docking cam: Added a button to make the docking cam window bigger.

Locations panel: The "Show locations on map" buttons is once again enabled.

The scanner should now use the energy amount it says it will use.

The movement buttons in the tractor beam menu will now only move/rotate the lazors attached to the tractor beam system (you can have more than one via the config tab)

Increased the electric charge regeneration rate of the main Lazor System modules to that of the stock PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator.

The gimballing issues with the stackable lazor system module has been resolved, well almost.

Moved all the sound files from lazor system to PluginData/romfarer/sound. This should save up a tiny bit of memory and disk space.

Moved all the textures to PluginData/romfarer/textures



UPDATE Jan 8, 2013 : Version 20
---------------------------------------------------------
Plane LGF: Redesigned the GUI of Lazor guided flight for planes. The top part now shows the current yaw, pitch and roll settings (the actual setting of the control surfaces). Under this are some values for turnrate. The new thing here is the turn coordinator slider which shows the current side slip of your plane. Have the ball in the middle for 
maximal efficiency. The rest of the panel has been split up in 3 parts, Manual control, Pitch/altitude control and Yaw/bearing control the two latter are automatic systems and will disable the manual inputs for their designated areas. Advanced Control Options is only for users who are interested in controllers, if you don't know what it means, it is nothting to worry about.

Rocket LGF: Added maneuver node targeting. This option will only point your rocket in the direction of the active control node. If no node is active, it won't work.

Docking cam: Restructured the numerical readouts and added readouts for angular velocity.

Docking cam: Added a graphical readout which shows the angular relationship between the top point of each docking node.

Docking cam: Hopefully fixed the issue with unsopported shaders. A non shaded camera (normal view) will be used when the grayscale shader is not supported.

Built in scanning system: Removed the range limit on this system. Given that you have enough energy you can scan for stuff as far away as you like. For example, a 100km scan costs 10k energy. But it will find everything within that range.

Fixed some issues related to configuring vessel as Rocket/Plane.

Locations list: added a button to add target location to the list.

Target list: The KSC buildings added are now the ones at KSC.

Target indicators and trackers will now show up on the map.

Locations will only show up on the map when the location is within 5000km of the camera.

Locations will now be visible on tab-selected planets in the map view.

Target cam: Fixed an issue causing artifacts.

Target cam: Now with a lot more zoom

Added 4 classic planes to the Lazor System Package. These are the ones i have used to buil/test the new lazor guided flight: Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Bombardier CRJ-900, Fokker 50 and a Vampire T11


UPDATE Dec 28, 2012 : Version 19
---------------------------------------------------------
Added support for ksp targeting: This global option is available in the Config tab and can be turned on and off from there. When turned off, lazor system and ksp will track targets individually. When turned on, lazor system will automatically get the target from ksp, if a target is dropped in ksp, lazor will drop the target as well. This works the same the other way around.

A "Lock" switch has been added to Remote control and Resource transfer so these systems don't requre the constant focus of the main lazor to operate.

Tabs should now keep their ordering on save/load.

The target list will now contain all vessels and KSC buildings on default.

KPS locations in map view can now be turned on and off from the Config tab or the Target tab's location section.

Docking cam updated with graphical displays for angle and relative velocity. The white cross shows your alignment, and the red cross shows your relative speed. So when the stipled cross, the white cross and the red cross is on the docking port, then you are perfectly aligned for docking.

Docking cam should no longer hide the pause menu. The pause menu will in stead hide the docking cam (technical reasons).

Docking cam is now available as a separate module. This will operate just like the docking cam's enabled by Lazor System, but obviously doesn't require a Lazor System to be on, to use, unless you add it to a vessel that has Lazor System. The camera module requires romfarer.dll and the PartData from the Lazor System installation folder. To enable this, simply add the following to a docking port .cfg. 
MODULE
{
    name = LazorSystemDockingCamera
}


UPDATE Dec 21, 2012 : Version 18
---------------------------------------------------------
Removed the following subsystems from the subsystems tab: Lazor vision, Map Augmentor and KPS. These functions have been integrated in other parts of the system. The Kerbal Positioning System (KPS) is now part of the Targets tab. This tab will either show targets or locations. Nightvision can now be found on the main panel. Axis overlays were moved to the Heading section on the main panel. The parts of Laror Vision and Map augmentor that were showing velocity vectors were integrated into the Parameters Tab. Select the marked parameters to see these overlays.

The docking camera has been updated with numerical readouts for distance, relative velocity and angle in the x and y directions relative to the docking port the camera is attached to. In addition, all docking ports on a vessel will now be detected on startup and will have a docking camera attached, regardless of where the lazor system main module is placed. It does however require at least one main module to be activated.

Added a Scanning system to the main panel. This system will when activated send out a sonar pulse, adding everything within range to the target list. The energy required for this pulse is range / 10. 

The tractor beam system has been overhauled. The system is now split in 3 modes. Manual, Hover and Lift. In addition, readouts for efficiency and energy use has been added.

Lazor System will now remember window and tab positions when loading vessels.

The docking camera placed on the Lateral docking port should now point in the right direction.

Fixed an issue with attempting to run the afterburner system when no liguid fuel is present.

Popups should now appear in front of all other windows.

The launch clamp fix from the version 17 has been fixed. It will now trigger even if the lazor system is deactivated.

Updates made to the energy management system. 

And a lot of core updates aimed at enhancing the system's overall performance


UPDATE Dec 12, 2012 : Version 17
---------------------------------------------------------
LazorSystem and key subsystems now require energy to operate: LazorSystem stores energy and it's fusion reactor create a small amount of energy, enough to run some systems. Each lazor will drain a small amount of energy when turned on. Tractor beams will drain energy proportional to the force they put out. More energy management stuff will come and the values might be tuned according to feedback.

The bug which caused launch clamps to follow your vessel has been fixed. Launch clamps will now explode when the vessel enters the flying state.

Fixed a bug which caused some vessels with lazor system installed to wobble.

Interplanetary Transfer System has been enabled again.

Decimal points on esource readouts should now be more informative.

Changed the name of the parameter "Altitude fT" to "Altitude terrain".

The target camera has been augmented and will no longer show the main lazor as a flickering star in the middle.

Fixed a bug that caused the target list to show two listings for the vessel you are operating.

Sunbeam now requires large amounts of electrical charge to fire.

Changed the ordering of the Target list


UPDATE Dec 8, 2012 : Version 16
---------------------------------------------------------
Added two main modules, which are stackable. When you put a docking port on top of these modules, the docking port gets the ability to open up a docking camera. To enable this, simply right click on the docking port and click the "Activate Docking Camera" button.

Sunbeam: fixed an issue with icons duplicating in the VAB.

Target cam, fixed an issue when targeting celesial bodies.

Parameters: selection is working again.


UPDATE Dec 6, 2012 : Version 15
---------------------------------------------------------
Docking with lazor system is now supported.

A vessel may now have many lazors systems attached. You can change which lazor system has control by right clicking on the module. It is adviced to turn systems off on lazor systems that don't have focus, to avoid unexpected behavior from systems compeating for control. That said it is possible to have different system modules run their own subsystems and you should be able to have many main modules run as many systems as you want, the same systems or what ever combination you can imagine. From the config menu you can assign what lazors you want each system to control.

Sunbeam/Missiles/Bombs: Staging fixed and the icons are working again. Added action group support as well.

Missiles/Bombs: Added an option to deploy these by right clicking on them.

Feedback needed.


UPDATE Dec 4, 2012 : Version 14
---------------------------------------------------------
Parameters tab updated with extensive resource readouts: current amount, max amount, flow rate and depletion/restoration time.

Fuel transfer system has been renamed to Resource transfer and can now handle any resource in the game.

Afterburner is now working again, and easier to use.


UPDATE NOV 30, 2012 : Beta 13
---------------------------------------------------------
New GUI: I updated the whole gui of lazor system with a new skin. In addition the red lazor button has been replaced with a smaller one with two buttons on it. One to turn the system on and off, and one to open the gui itself. You may now run any of the panels without having the main panel displayed. 

The sound for startup and shutdown is now controlled by the UI volume in setting. All the other sounds are handled by the spacecraft volume.


UPDATE NOV 24, 2012 : Beta 12
---------------------------------------------------------
New Achievements system, accessible from the Achievements tab which is located in the middle of all the other tabs (to the left of the main panel). With this system you will get points for landing on planets, orbiting planets, and returning from landing missions, and a few more missions. Also this system will track all kerbals killed and vessels destroyed. 

I put lazors on the EVA jumpsuits. I have planned more functionality for this, which will hopefully come in the next version.

Most of the parameter readouts on the Parameters tab and the Target Cam tab are now selectable.

Remote control (accessed by the blue lazor form the main module) has been completely re-written in anticipation of 0.18.

Sunbeam has been updated with an icon and sound when the laser is firing.


UPDATE Nov 9, 2012 : Beta 11
---------------------------------------------------------
All Lazor System parts have been re-modelled. The system now consists of 1 Lazor System module and 5 colored lazors. 

Color crystals have been removed.

Tosh's sunbeam has been added to the package and will receive Lazor System control where applicable.

Note: This update will break all existing Lazor vessels due to the new models.


UPDATE Oct 31, 2012 : Beta 10b
---------------------------------------------------------
Added RCS transfer to the Fuel Transfer system.

Reduced the maximum range of fuel transfer to 10km and set heavy diminshing returns beyond 500 meter.

Fixed an issue with icons not showing up.

Added a smaller version of the Lazor Bomb


UPDATE Oct 30, 2012 : Beta 10
---------------------------------------------------------
KSP 0.17.1 compability update.

Tractor beams have been updated with support for spaceplanes. In addition this system now comes with a stabilizing function which uses the tractor beams to stabilize your vessel in a direction opposite of gravity. 

The EVA support system has been overhauled. Whenever you go on EVA a special lazor system interface will appear. From here you can access systems applicable to kerbals on eva such as "beam aboard", jetpack and lamp. More functions are coming to this gui soon, as i had to push the uptdate to release the compatibility fix.

The teleport system is now able to teleport kerbals down from 90km orbits. 


UPDATE Oct 12, 2012 : Beta 9
---------------------------------------------------------
The "Tracking Station Linkup" (blue system) is updated with an orbital transfer system. This system is designed to guide you with transfering between celestial bodies and comes with both a numberical and graphical display. See the Subsystems section for detailed explanations and tutorials.

Added custom icon to all parts. The icon's does dissapear when loading, this is a known ksp bug which is being fixed.

Kerbal Positioning System: Latitude and longitude will now show up when mousing-over the blue location labels.

Added proximity detonation to type 2 lazor controlled modules (missiles and bombs)

Updated module control with a new guidance system for extra precision.

Target cam will now show the celestial bodies correctly when targeted. Except the one in your SoI :/

More directions added to rocket lazor guided flight


UPDATE Sep 14, 2012 : Beta 8
---------------------------------------------------------
Lazor System is NOW 0.17 compatible!

Added a lot of celestial body parameters to target info, when a celestial body is targeted. Enjoy checking out the new planets parameters.

Added a bunch of new parameters including: dynamic pressure, time to ap and pe, orbital period, etc.

KPS system gets an infusion of map locations from the Kerbin Geographic And Science Society. I also added some latitude/longitude displays to the add and edit popup menues. And it is also possible to view/add/edit with both decimal and sexagesimal number formats.

New tab, Modules: This marks the start of the process of integrating other devices with LazorSystem. To that end i have added a lazor guided missile and bomb which will work by itself, and receive lazor guidance when used on a vessel with lazor system installed.

Target Cam updated with crew and fuel displays. I also added a expand button to make the window bigger.

LazorVision now has an option to enable night-vision and invert-ision on the main camera. I also added an option to display global (NSEWUD), local (FBLRUD) axis and a graphical velocity indicator.

Added a new wobble controller to lazor guided flight, if you can optimize the pid control under "advanced options", please let me know the numbers.

Added "up"/"down" buttons to tractor beam hover and lift systems. Also added a max power slider to the system.

Adjusted the range of all tractor beams. The effective range is now 1000m and max range is 5000m. The power output will decrease linearly between effective and max range. Example: at 3000m the force output will be 12,5N per beam, as opposed to 25N per beam at 1000m

Adjusted afterburner output on liquid engines. It should no longer increase the efficiency of the engines.
    It is now possible to add a kps location based on where the lead lazor would hit the planet. 


UPDATE Aug 25, 2012 : Beta 7
---------------------------------------------------------
The tractor beam system has been expanded with a Hover mode and a Liting mode. Hover mode is designed to make your vessel hover at a certain altitude above the ground (remember to point the lazors at the ground to do this). The Lifting system is designed to lift other vessels, or keep vessels in orbit at a certain distance. Keep in mind that the controllers for this system still needs tweaking.

New gui panel, Config: (Leave this window alone if  you want the system to operate like you are used to.) The purpose of this panel is to re-configure Lazor System, specifically assign lazors to subsystems with the goal of making it possible to run several copies of each system. Use the up and down arrow buttons on the left to assign and unassign lazor groups. The star button assigns the lazor group to a new subsystem. If you have two or more subsystem in one color group, you must select 1 group you wish to assign the lazor group to and a merge button will appear.

Warp safety measures have now been implemented in the EVA support system. 

Tractor beams will now affect the active vessel if SafeMode (SM button on the main panel) is deactivated. This should allow for roflcopters and other contraptions.

Fuel transfer system will now properly detect capacities on legacy fuel tanks.

Afterburner will now trigger properly on legacy engines.

An error message will appear if you try to launch a vessel with more than 1 lazor system installed.

Remote detonation explosions are back.

Tweaked the throttle range of afterburner.

Afterburner sound will now turn off on pause.


UPDATE: Aug 14, 2012 : Beta 6 
---------------------------------------------------------

Fuel Transfer: This system is spawned by placing yellow lazors on your vessel. (red crystal + green crystal + lazor) It will transfer fuel between your vessels automatically in a top-down fashion. 

After Burner: Kerbals discovered quickly that fuel burns, burn create thrust, and the more fuel you burn the more thrust you get. Ignite your fuel at your own peril!

Updated fuel, fuel depletion, fuel burn rate etc. displays in the Parameters tab.

Drag/Drop/Dock windows. For example: Drag and drop the Parameters window to wherever you want it on the screen. Make it snap back with the arrow button.

Also added DDD support for subsystems. Now you can have Lazor Guided Flight and all other subsystems in their own windows.


UPDATE: Aug 5, 2012 : Beta 5
---------------------------------------------------------

TRACTOR BEAMS: This new lazor will apply force to targets it hits. It follows newtonian mechanics so if you apply force to something, you will receive and equal amount of force at the point of origin. To spawn this system you must equip your vessel with magenta colored lazors (red crystal + blue crystal + lazor). Having this system installed also enhances EVA support and adds stabilizing beams to this system. See the attached VAB vessels for configuration details.

Hopefully eliminated some fluttering from planes controlled by Lazor Guided Flight(LGF)

LGF for rockets has been improved. (New and improved direction and SAS algorithms)

Tweaked RSAS: This SAS will kill spin and angular speed. Input disables the SAS for the given angle.

For example while you pitch the rocket, the pitch cancelling SAS will be disabled while roll and yaw is still damped.

LGF(planes) gets parking brakes

LGF(planes) target and great circle path is now only displayed on the map

LGF keyboard input is now disabled during EVA

Horizontal lidar will now adjust the aim to the horizon for lazors in reasonable positions.

Removed some invisible objects from hit detection and made terrain colliders not show up on the target display.

Fixed the oldest bug in lazor system, no more "lazoreggs". 



UPDATE: Jul 26, 2012 : Beta 4
---------------------------------------------------------

Beta Changelog History
===========================================================


UPDATE: Jul 22, 2012 : Beta 3

0.16 Compatibility updates.
Someone requested more flare so i replaced the main module with something more flashy ;D.
Added some sounds to on, off and change color buttons.
Visual changes to lazor button and KPS map system.


UPDATE: Jul 17, 2012 : Beta 2

Kerbal Positioning System: Available on all configurations of lazor system. Allows you to mark locations on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. All locations you have marked are stored in PluginData/romfarer/kps.txt and will be available on all your vessels that run Lazor System. It is also possible to share these locations with your friends, just punk the new location into that list and it should work ;)
GUI overlay stuff such as the target indicator, lazor vision and map augments will now appear behind the GUI.
Added a target triangle to the global map. This will show up when flying towards a target in Lazor Guided Flight.


UPDATE: Jul 4, 2012 : Beta 1

Lazor system gets a brand new animated button to mark the start of the beta phase. :D Hoorrayyy!
Map Augmentor: This system (prototype) is available on all configurations of lazor system and will enhance your map experience. The first feature is a green arrow that points in the direction of your vessel.
Lazor Guided Flight has a new \'Fly to coordinate\' function which uses great circle theory to plot the most efficient course to your destination which you can select on the map or enter numerically.
Lazor Guided Flight also gets a new system 'Altitude control' which ATTEMPTS to keep your plane flying at a fixed altitude.
LIDAR subsystem is now more systematic and has 2 additional operating modes.



Alpha Changelog History
===========================================================


UPDATE: Jun 16, 2012 : Alpha 3-1

Tasks window has been renamed to Subsystems.
New subsystem, LazorVision: In this mode the HUD will display impact markers for all lazors with distance and angles.
Updated parameters window with more values and made it possible to show physical parameters in both surface and orbit mode.
Changed rotation and angle display for the lead lazor and brought it in line with the bearing/mark system. Also added a button to switch between local and global coordinate systems
NightVision is now less green and lights up the night scene better.
Added a prototype thermal vision to the target cam.
Added \'follow target\' mode for rocket version of lazor guided flight AND \'follow me\' mode for remote control.


UPDATE: Jun 8, 2012 : Alpha 3

Fixed the display of the target cam to show the world almost correctly, and added nightvision and invert-vision.
Added a new gui window, Parameters, which displays hopefully useful information about your flight.
Added precision mode to lazor guided flight and lazor rotation/movement buttons.
Increased the range of the lazor system to 95000 meter. The range of remote control has been increased accordingly.
Improved handling of airplanes in lazor guided flight. Now more stable than ever.
Removed the H,V,G buttons and replaced them with a Rocket and Plane button which changes the operating mode of the system, it only affects lazor guided flight atm.


UPDATE: May 31, 2012 : Alpha 2-7

Lazor Guided Flight. New control scheme for airplanes. Adds the ability to more precisely manage an airplanes yaw, pitch and roll factors either by keyboard or mouse input. In addition this system comes with a damping function which is designed to smooth out turbulence or inherent \'wobbliness\' of aircraft. (Please refer to the attached .craft 'Stabba' for details on how to assemble this system)
The red Lazor tracking system is now globally available.
Removed Cyan lazor system. This system has been replaced by the Lazor guided flight system.
Added a pointy end to the top of color crystals.


UPDATE: May 24, 2012 : Alpha 2-6

Target Cam. See what the lazor is seeing.
Stabilizing System. Makes your rocket or aircraft fly straight. This system is spawned by putting cyan lazors on your vessel. (Green and blue color crystals).
Added some aircraft compability stuff including buttons to modify the coordinate system the lazors operate in. 
If you have any parts of a lazor system already attached to a craft, you will most likely have to re-assamble the lazor system. (If it doesn\'t explode you\'re good to go =P)


UPDATE: May 18, 2012 : Alpha 2-5 (0.15 compatible)

Compatibility for 0.15
The lead lazor can now be operated in mouse-look mode.
Hotkeys: 'v' to activate mouse-look. 'b' to change color of lead lazor.
Added a test scenario to the bundle.[/li]


UPDATE: May 14, 2012 : Alpha 2-4

Remote Control system. Take control of another vessel, make it change stage and throttle. This system also has a stabilize function which is designed to make docking a lot easier.
Updated the GUI with a new Tasks window that displays all systems spawned by side-mounted lazors.
Added a White color type to the leader lazors. The blue lazor system is the main feature in this alpha and i would really appreciate suggestions as how the other colored leader lazors should work.


UPDATE: May 10, 2012 : Alpha 2-3

LIDAR system.
Target tracking system. Track as many targets as you want.
Target interface got an upgrade.
Remote Self-Destruct. Detonates all parts on the craft in sequence for maximum effect.
Introduced a whole new range of exceptions related to remote detonation and systems actively tracking/scanning the detonated vessel. This is expected but PLEASE report if the game locks up!!!


UPDATE: May 5, 2012 : Alpha 2-2

Adjustable readouts for lead lazors angle/rotation. (a2-1)
Lead lazor can now change color in flight. (a2-2)
Blue lead lazor + 1 or more blue attached lazor now spawn the Tracking Station interface. (a2-2)


UPDATE: April 29, 2012 : Alpha 2

I have been doing a lot of work on this system the last few days and i hope it shows. In stead of the one part, the system now consists of 5 parts: 

Lazor system
Lazor emitter
3 color crystals (red, green and blue)


UPDATE: April 25, 2012 : Alpha 1 Prototype
