	description = Cunning marketing executives discovered a way to get rid of defective Service Modules by simply cutting off the fuel tank and selling them as an alternative decoupler compatible with the company's 2.5m Heat Shield, with some bonus avionics thrown in for good measure. The unit comes with pyrotechnic tension ties to separate the heat-shielded pod from the module itself prior to re-entry as well as an integrated fuel cell assembly to generate electricity from any nearby fuel/oxidizer tanks in the absence of sunlight.
