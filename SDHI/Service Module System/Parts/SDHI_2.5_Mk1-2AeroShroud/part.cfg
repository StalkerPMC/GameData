	description = Originally improperly-manufactured SDHI Service Module Fairings, these otherwise defective parts found a new purpose after an intrepid engineering intern discovered that with some banging and shouting, they fitted perfectly over Kerlington's Mk1-2 Pod and offered ample protection against both Escape Tower debris and avian fecal matter. For best results, pair with your favourite Launch Escape System (LES).
