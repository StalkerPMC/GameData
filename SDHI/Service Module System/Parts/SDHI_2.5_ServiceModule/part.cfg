	description = Designed for use with Kerlington's Mk1-2 Command Pod, this services and propulsion module is ideal for extended standalone operations in Low Kerbin Orbit, as a crew ferry to and from space stations, or short trips to the Mun and Minimus with the use of the client's own injection stage. The unit comes with pyrotechnic tension ties to separate the heat-shielded pod from the module itself prior to re-entry, ample surface area to attach RCS thrusters/communications antennae/PV Solar Arrays, as well as an integrated fuel cell assembly to generate electricity in the absence of sunlight.
