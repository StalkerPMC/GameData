	description = It can get lonesome in space, and the furry creatures in this module are sure to brighten any Kerbal's day. Also, observing them can provide new scientific insights. The creatures eat "kibbal", but can hibernate should it run out. The "bioproducts" they produce can be used to complete various experiments.
