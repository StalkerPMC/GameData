===== Features =====

* Self Destruct - makes the entire vessel explode! Make sure you EVA your crew first!
* Explode - only makes the Self Destruct part explode. Useful for creating a little
      explosion or getting rid of the extra weight. Not responsible for damage to the
      vessel.
* Can now be activated from EVA.
* The Self Destruct now waits 10 seconds, and goes through a countdown sequence,
      before activating.
